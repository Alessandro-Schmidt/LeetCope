-- Answer:
SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans 
from Visits v 
LEFT JOIN Transactions t 
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id  
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL 
GROUP BY v.customer_id;


-- Even more sophisticated answer (made by LeetCode editorial):
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  COUNT(visit_id) AS count_no_trans 
FROM
